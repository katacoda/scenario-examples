There is a famous play and 1951 film _A Streetcar Named Desire_ by Tennessee Williams. It has a famous line, "Hey Stella!". Stella Kowalski is one of the main characters in the play. [Marlon Brando said her name the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1A0p0F_iH8). Search the play's manuscript to see how many times her name is spoken with and without a passionate exclamation point. Create a property file called `stella.properties` and place the word counts for each of these keys:

```properties
stella=?
stella_exclamation=?
```

In the current directory, there is a file `streetcar.pdf`. Using [pdftotext](https://ubuntu.pkgs.org/20.04/ubuntu-main-arm64/poppler-utils_0.86.1-0ubuntu1_arm64.deb.html), you'll need to convert this `streetcar.pdf` to `streetcar.txt` to count the words.

💡 Consider that water closets are no places to count words.
